							<h2>Burrus Hall</h2>
							<p>Burrus Hall is the de facto center of Virginia Tech's Campus. You can see it standing tall from almost anywhere
							around the drillfield, and it is a classic photo opp for visitors.</p>

							<h2>Changing Leaves</h2>
							<p>Fall is one of the best seasons in Blacksburg. There's football, cooler weather, and all the leaves around campus change to
							beautiful shades of orange and red. As you can see, this tree is right between seasons as it begins to change colors.</p>

							<h2>Eggleston Hall</h2>
							<p>Alomst all the buildings on campus are made from Hokie stone, which gives them a "Hogwarts" type of feel. Many students
							ride their bikes around on nice days like this one, and there are plenty of bike racks to go around.</p>

							<h2>The Drillfield</h2>
							<p>While the main purpose of the Drillfield was to give the Corps of Cadets a place to march, it is also a great place
							to throw a frisbee or enjoy some sunshine when the weather is nice.</p>

							<h2>Torgersen Bridge</h2>
							<p>Torgersen Bridge is another classic piece of architecture on campus. However, it also serves some practical purposes.
							The bridge connects Torgerson Hall to Newman Library, and it also provides a nice, quiet place to study inside.</p>

							<h2>The Pylons</h2>
							<p>The pylons were build to represent the eight core values of Virginia Tech: Brotherhood, Honor, Leadership, Sacrifice,
								Service, Loyalty, Duty, and Ut Prosim. They also serve as a scenic overlook of the drillfield.</p>

							<h2>Architecture of Virginia Tech</h2>
							<p>This is a close up view of Togersen Bridge. It shows off the interesting texture of the Hokie Stone, and you can also
							see the university's full name, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, sculpted into the arch.</p>

							<h2>New Cadet Hall</h2>
							<p>These are the stairs leading up to the New Cadet Hall. In the middle, there is a statue of
							a soldier looking up towards the building. You can also see a symoblic American flag in the background.</p>

							<h2>Lane Hall</h2>
							<p>As you can probably tell by the outdated green roof, Lane Hall is one of the oldest buildings on campus.
							 It was built in 1888. You cannot tell in this picture, but from overhead, the red bricks form a V and a T.</p>

							<h2>Memorial Flag</h2>
							<p>The large American flag that sits outside Lane Hall and the Cadet dorms was erected 99 years ago by the
							class of 1919. As you can read on the placard, it is dedicated to the Virginia Tech alumni who died in France in WW1.</p>

							<h2>Dapper Dan</h2>
							<p>Throughout Virginia Tech's campus, there are many places to just sit and enjoy the nice weather. Whether it be studying
							outside or just taking in some rays, Hokies love to spend time outdoors, just like my dear friend Dan is.</p>

							<h2>Blacksburg Wildlife</h2>
							<p>Ok, so Blacksburg is admittedly not teeming with wild animals. However, we do have a lot of cattle and
							a lot of insects. These butterflies are way more interesting to look at than the bees who try to land on your food.</p>
